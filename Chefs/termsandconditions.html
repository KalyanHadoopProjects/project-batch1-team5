                        The client herewith agrees to meet all the requirements of the concerned authorities who conduct
                        an
                        assessment or decide on visa outcome. The client also agreed to submit all the documents
                        including
                        originals if required by the concerned assessing authorities. The client understands that any
                        failure on his/her part to submit these documents or part thereof is an independent failure of
                        client and KHA is in no way responsible for the same. Hence, the client agrees that failure to
                        produce documents cannot be a valid reason to claim a refund.</p>

                    <p>-
                        The client will inform KHA about every news involving a change of housing/mailing address,

                        of
                        permanent residence permit. The client's inability to do the same will only show that no
                        reimbursement at all is outstanding of any advisory charges given to the immigration
                        consultancy.
                    </p>
                    <p>-
                        The client shall also make certain that he/she is married or in any relationship which is
                        acceptable to be considered as dependent- the spouse or the acceptable dependent/s appears for
                        an
                        IELTS/ French test and offers a report with minimum score as is appropriate on the basis of the
                        decided service level agreement with Kosus Hospitality Alliance. The client fully understands
                        and
                        concurs that his petition cannot be presented minus the needed IELTS/French points of the
                        marital
                        partner even while no compensation of the advisory/consulting charges given to Kosus Hospitality
                        Alliance will be claimed or made in a situation, wherein he fails to receive the service level
                        agreement prescribed IELTS/French total of the marital partner. The said test, together with the
                        associated report, is necessary towards the documentation for wedded clients through the client
                        may
                        not ask for points for the qualifications of his partner.</p>

                    <p>-By signing/acknowledging the agreement to avail our
                        services, the client cannot withdraw AT ANY
                        POINT during the process because of own personal circumstances which may have changed. It is
                        unacceptable to consider or entertain any form of settlement. As a business with heavy
                        investment,
                        we cannot accommodate requests for reimbursement once service have been provided for or when any
                        part of the process has commenced.</p>

                    <p>-The secretarial charges given to Kosus Hospitality Alliance
                        does not comprise any amount owned to
                        any government organization, and to any language testing group or for any other reason, and
                        shall be
                        restricted to the service and duties of the consultancy as duly set and decided under the
                        service
                        level agreement inked separately with the client.</p>

                    <p>-The client clearly accepts that he has been apprised of the
                        usual waiting durations/average
                        processing visa office/appraisal body. The client also fully agreed and realises that he will
                        never
                        have any claims whatsoever on any sort of refund of the charge made on or off-site,on ground of
                        the
                        extended petition processing time periods.</p>

                    <p>- Kosus Hospitality Alliance has not offered any sort of
                        assurance, advice or pledge on work or job
                        assurance, following an approval for the permit and after landing for any given overseas
                        country. No
                        compensation will be claimed of any advisory/consulting/secretarial service charges offered
                        earlier
                        to Kosus Hospitality Alliance has been unable to offer a job guarantee aboard.</p>

                    <p>-There are certain countries which have a cap system, and
                        hence the approval of visa/Green card/
                        Permanent residence is subject to the cap not reached for that year. The client may have the
                        required points as required by the immigration authorities of the specified country, but he/she
                        still may not get the visa/Green card/Permanent residence if the cap has been reached for that
                        year.
                        Failing to get visa/Green card/Permanent residence because of the cap limit cannot be a reason
                        for
                        claiming a refund, and client fully understands the same.</p>

                    <p>-If your request for a reimbursement falls under the
                        acceptable terms and conditions of the Kosus
                        Hospitality Alliance and the service agreement,the time taken to process such a request would be
                        30
                        working days.</p>

                    <p>-The service amount was written is for the full service as

                        is at
                        the client's discretion, and the Kosus Hospitality Alliance will not be held responsible for
                        these
